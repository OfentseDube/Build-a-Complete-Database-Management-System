Description of What the Project Does

The SQL script you've provided is for setting up a basic Clinic Booking System database.  Here's a description of its functionality:

User Management: It handles users of the system, assigning them roles (admin, doctor, or patient). This is managed in the roles and users tables.
Doctor Information: It stores information about doctors, including their names, specialization, and which user account is associated with them (doctors table).
Patient Information: It stores information about patients, including their personal details and associated user account (patients table).
Appointment Scheduling: The core functionality is managing appointments. It records which doctor and patient are involved, the date and time of the appointment, the appointment status, and any notes (appointments table).
Data Integrity: It uses foreign keys to ensure relationships between tables (e.g., an appointment must be linked to an existing doctor and patient). It also uses a unique key constraint to prevent double-booking of appointments.
How to Run/Setup the Project (Import SQL)

To run or set up this project (i.e., create the database and tables), you need a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB.  Here's a general outline using MySQL as an example:

Install MySQL: If you haven't already, download and install MySQL on your computer.
Access MySQL Command Line (or Client): Open your terminal or command prompt and log in to your MySQL server using the MySQL command-line tool or a client like MySQL Workbench. You'll need your MySQL username and password.
Create the Database:
At the MySQL prompt, type: CREATE DATABASE netcareDB; (or you can choose a different name if you prefer).
Then, select the database: USE netcareDB;
Execute the SQL Script:
If using the command line, you can execute the script from the file: SOURCE /path/to/your/netcareDB.sql; (Replace /path/to/your/netcareDB.sql with the actual path to the file).
Alternatively, you can copy and paste the entire SQL script into the MySQL command line or client and run it. The client tools often have a button to execute the SQL.
